# Machine Pools

The `MachinePool` resource provisions a machine pool against an existing OCM cluster.

The only prerequisite is that you have a cluster in OCM capable of attaching machine pools from 
OCM such as ROSA.

The [samples directory](https://github.com/rh-mobb/ocm-operator/tree/main/config/samples/machinepool) 
gives a fairly exhaustive and descriptive set of different machine pool configurations.
